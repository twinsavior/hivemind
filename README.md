## Get Started

### Prerequisites (required for ALL install methods)

HIVEMIND uses Claude as its brain. You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ and the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then run `claude` once to authenticate with your Anthropic account.

> **Stuck on "Starting your swarm"?** This almost always means `claude` isn't installed or isn't on your PATH. Run `claude --version` in your terminal to check.

---

### Option A: Download the Desktop App (easiest)

1. **Mac**: [Download the .dmg](https://github.com/twinsavior/hivemind/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.7/HIVEMIND-1.0.0-beta.7-arm64.dmg) → open it → drag HIVEMIND to Applications
   - First launch: right-click the app → Open (macOS requires this for unsigned apps)
2. **Windows**: [Download the .exe](https://github.com/twinsavior/hivemind/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.7/HIVEMIND-Setup-1.0.0-beta.7.exe) → run it → done
3. Launch HIVEMIND. The onboarding wizard walks you through everything.

### Option B: Run from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/twinsavior/hivemind.git
cd hivemind
pnpm install        # requires pnpm 10+ (npm install -g pnpm)

# 2. Build the server
pnpm build

# 3. Run the desktop app
cd desktop
npm install
npm start
```

> **Build tools needed:** macOS: `xcode-select --install` · Linux: `apt install build-essential python3` · Windows: install Visual Studio Build Tools

## What is HIVEMIND?

HIVEMIND is a desktop app that gives you an AI-powered team for your reselling business. It runs a swarm of 6 specialized agents — led by **Nova**, your AI co-founder — that handle the daily grind: parsing purchase emails, tracking profitability, monitoring account health, and managing your source-to-sale pipeline.

Everything runs locally on your machine. Your data never leaves your computer. No cloud, no subscription fees for the platform itself.

**Built for the Buy Box / FlipAlert seller community.**

---

## ✨ Features

- **Email automation** — Parses purchase confirmations, shipment tracking, and seller alerts from 15+ retailers (Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Target, Costco, etc.) via Gmail OAuth or IMAP. Multi-account support with validated connections and encrypted credential storage
- **Marketplace APIs** — Connects to Amazon SP-API, Walmart Seller Center, and eBay REST APIs for orders, inventory, FBA shipments, and account health
- **Financial tracking** — SimpleFIN Bridge integration syncs bank/credit card transactions, auto-categorizes spend (sourcing, prep, shipping, fees)
- **Profitability calculator** — Per-item ROI across Amazon, Walmart, and eBay using exact fee lookups
- **Source-to-sale pipeline** — Tracks items through 8 stages: Purchased → Shipped to Prep → Prepping → Shipped to FBA → Received → Live → Sold → Settled
- **Account health monitoring** — Alerts for suspensions, policy violations, IP complaints, and performance warnings

### AI Agent Swarm
